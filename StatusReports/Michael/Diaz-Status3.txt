"Hopefully I can get a decent start on the feature I was assigned, being "RSVPing to an event"."

With a crazy week like the one I had, I was unfortunately unable to start on the pages this week. With more free time for week this week, 
I expect to change that statement. We worked on our sprint 3 this week and really defined our database names and helped set the final picture of the site up. 
Getting familiar with the database system is gonna be my number one priority this week. 
My goal is to get comfortable with flask a bit more and the fully understand how it interacts with the database that we make.
