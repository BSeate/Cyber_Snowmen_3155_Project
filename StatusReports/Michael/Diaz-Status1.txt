We setup wireframes for our applications this week. Gave us kind of an idea as to what we're working with and maybe a bit about how our website is going to be structured. I'll be committing my work on the 29th as far as the individual reports go to get some practice with git. The project was separated into two branches; the main branch and dev branch. This hopefully keeps us a bit organized when it comes to the rest of the work.

Everything from last week was finished pretty much during our meeting. We setup the whole wireframing visuals and all. This week we hope to get a decent look at how the database works. A lot of this application seems to rely on the database in some fashion, and having a good grasp on that idea could really help smooth things along down the road. Hopefully I can get a decent start on the feature I was assigned, being "RSVPing to an event".
