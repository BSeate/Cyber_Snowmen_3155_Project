From last week:
* N/A




Progress this week:
* Assigned parts of project to team members
* Looked over possible solutions and implementations of various features that were assigned to myself
* Worked on Flask practice activities
* Figuring out a schedule
* Figuring out when I’m available
* Figuring out which “Backlog” item I should focus on
* Figuring out the best way to communicate with group me



Goals this next week:
* Start on a basic outline of features with the team.
* Work on assigned features and look into examples where they have been implemented before and how to improve upon them.
* Committing to appropriate assigned backlogs
* Focusing on a right schedule for me and group members
* Visualize backlog items
* Establish appropriate communication lines between group members
